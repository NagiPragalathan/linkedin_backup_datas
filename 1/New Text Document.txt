I'm thrilled to let you in on some exciting news today! Blits Estates, a Web3 real estate platform, underwent a security audit that SecureDApp successfully completed. The audit determined that the platform is secure for transactions and did not uncover any significant security flaws.
I'm glad to report that we have taken the necessary efforts to make sure that our platform is as safe as possible because I know that security is a major priority for everyone at Blits Estates.
This security assessment is an important turning point in our effort to provide our users with a safe and secure platform for transactions.
