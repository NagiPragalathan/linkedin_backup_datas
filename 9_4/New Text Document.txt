I'm pleased to report that I completed the "Run For Polio" marathon, which is my first-ever marathon. I ran a 7.5-meter track in the competition, even though there were only two tracks available: a 5-kilometer and a 2.5-kilometer route. But I'm unsure of which direction to travel in, so I completed 2.5 kilometres before realising it wasn't my lap. I then completed my 5-kilometer loop, which was also a pleasant experience.And there were joyful and surprising moments. In that circumstance, I suddenly encountered my (hod)Kumaran Ma. And because I was so thrilled, thats why I bought the medal made by Hod.
