# LinkedIn Backup Data Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains the backup data from my previous LinkedIn account. Unfortunately, my old LinkedIn account was compromised and subsequently blocked by LinkedIn. As a result, I created a new account, but that too got blocked for reasons unknown to me. To ensure the safety of my data and retain the connections and posts I had, I've created this repository to store the backup.

## Background

In my original LinkedIn account, I had accumulated over 500 connections and had shared more than 20 posts related to various professional topics. Unfortunately, due to the unexpected circumstances, I lost access to my old account, making it impossible for me to continue building on the foundation I had created.

## Purpose of the Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to preserve the data from my old LinkedIn account, including my connections and posts. It serves as a backup to safeguard my professional network and the valuable content I shared.

## Repository Contents

- `connections.csv`: This file contains the details of my connections on LinkedIn.
- `posts/`: This directory holds the text and media content of the posts I made on my original LinkedIn account.

## Getting Involved

If you're one of my connections from my previous LinkedIn account and would like to reconnect, please feel free to reach out through [my new LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-new-linkedin-profile).

## Disclaimer

The data shared in this repository is for archival purposes only. It contains information from my previous LinkedIn account that I believe is important to keep. If you're one of the connections featured in this data and would like your information to be removed, please contact me directly.

## Final Words

Though my journey on LinkedIn faced unexpected challenges, I am excited to start anew. I will be posting my first update on this new journey shortly. Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,<br>
