Hello everyone ðŸ‘€ !
I hope you're having a great day. I wanted to share some exciting news with you all. I recently received an email confirming my selection as a participant in the prestigious GirlScript Summer of Code, organized by the esteemed GirlScript Foundation. I am absolutely thrilled and honored to be a part of this program and have the opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways.
Today, we had the Kickoff session, which was hosted by the incredible SHIVAM GARG and Nawed Ali. They provided valuable insights, answered our questions, and shared important dos and don'ts for the program. It was an amazing workshop that not only helped us gain a deeper understanding of the program but also left us feeling motivated and inspired to actively participate.
